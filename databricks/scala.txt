What is RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)?
RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) is a fundamental data structure of Spark and it is the primary data abstraction in Apache Spark and the Spark Core. RDDs are fault-tolerant, immutable distributed collections of objects, which means once you create an RDD you cannot change it. Each dataset in RDD is divided into logical partitions, which can be computed on different nodes of the cluster. 

In other words, RDDs are a collection of objects similar to collections in Scala, with the difference being RDD is computed on several JVMs scattered across multiple physical servers also called nodes in a cluster while a Scala collection lives on a single JVM.

Additionally, RDDs provide data abstraction of partitioning and distribution of the data which designed to run computations in parallel on several nodes, while doing transformations on RDD most of the time we donâ€™t have to worry of the parallelism as Spark by default provides.

This Apache Spark RDD tutorial describes the basic operations available on RDDs, such as map,filter, and persist etc using Scala example. In addition, this tutorial also explains Pair RDD functions which operate on RDDs of key-value pairs such as groupByKey and join etc.
